Change History
**************

1.7.1 (2016-02-13)
==================

- Do not copy source to target when ignore-existing is set #30
  [mgrbyte]

- Fix utf-8 error with Python 3.4 #32
  [thefunny42]


1.7 (2013-04-07)
================

 - New option, `mode`, to explicitly set the file mode of downloaded files when
   `download-only` is set to `true`. See
   https://github.com/hexagonit/hexagonit.recipe.download/pull/18
   [desaintmartin]

 - Travis CI support, see https://travis-ci.org/hexagonit/hexagonit.recipe.download
   [dokai]

 - Tox support for running tests.
   [dokai]

 - zc.buildout 2.x support. Latest versions of both 1.x and 2.x are supported.
   [toumorokoshi]

 - New option, `on-update`, which makes the recipe re-run itself on updates
   when set to `true`. Defaults to `false`. See
   https://github.com/hexagonit/hexagonit.recipe.download/pull/16
   [toumorokoshi]


1.6 (2012-11-14)
================

 - py3k support
   [iElectric]


1.5.1 (2012-07-13)
==================

 - Ensure that the temporary extraction directory gets deleted even if an error
   occurs later in the build. Previously it was possible for the temporary
   directory to fill up without limit. See
   https://github.com/hexagonit/hexagonit.recipe.download/pull/10 for details.
   [desaintmartin]

 - The download cache is no longer configured automatically because this could
   result in buildout errors if the default download cache directory was not
   created in time. See https://github.com/hexagonit/hexagonit.recipe.download/pull/9
   for details.
   [miano]

1.5.0 (2011-01-26)
==================

 - Implemented support for excluding paths while unpacking.
   [fschulze]

 - Reverted back to using ``zope.testing.doctest`` because on Python 2.4 the
   ``__file__`` variable is not available using stdlib ``doctest``. [dokai]

 - Fixed a spurious test failure because the results of ``ls()`` were
   unpredictable due to random filename hashing. [dokai]

 - Use the stdlib ``doctest`` module instead of ``zope.testing.doctest``.
   [dokai]

1.4.1 (2010-04-08)
==================

 - Implemented support for specifying the filename of a downloaded file when
   using ``download-only = true``. This closes
   http://github.com/hexagonit/hexagonit.recipe.download/issues#issue/3
   [dokai]

 - Fixed the filename handling for ``download-only = true``. The filename
   hashing introduced in 1.4.0 resulted in the names of the downloaded files
   to be hashed also. Now the original filename is preserved regardless
   whether filenames are hashed in the download cache. This closes
   http://github.com/hexagonit/hexagonit.recipe.download/issues#issue/2
   [dokai]

1.4.0 (2010-04-06)
==================

 - Changed the download policy to hash the downloaded filenames by default.
   You can revert back to the original behavior by setting a ``hash-name =
   false`` parameter in the section using the recipe. This closes
   http://github.com/hexagonit/hexagonit.recipe.download/issues#issue/1
   [dokai]

1.3.0 (2009-09-20)
==================

 - Removed support for the deprecated ``download-directory``
   option. [dokai]

 - Refactored the download logic to use the Download API in
   zc.buildout. We now require zc.buildout >= 1.4.0. [dokai]


1.2.2 (2009-08-17)
==================

 - Merged the current trunk (revision 79982) from the Plone Collective
   Subversion repository. The collective repository is now abandoned and the
   Github repository is the canonical one. [dokai]

 - Open files in binary mode when calculating MD5 checksums. This fixes a
   bug with checksums on the Windows platform. Bug report and patch thanks to
   Alexander Ivanov. [dokai]

1.2.1 (2008-04-13)
==================

 - Rename the buildout ``download-directory`` option to ``download-cache``
   (which is the name used by buildout) [thefunny]

 - Added BBB support for the ``download-directory`` option. It will
   emit a deprecation warning and set the ``download-cache`` option
   accordingly. [dokai]

1.2.0 (2008-01-19)
==================

 - Added the `download-only` option to allow downloading arbitrary
   files. [dokai]

1.1.0 (2007-10-14)
==================

 - Refactored the install method so recipe subclasses can override the base
   directory. For more info see ``calculate_base`` method on ``Recipe`` class.
   [hexsprite]

 - Recipe is now a new-style Python class so recipe subclasses can use super()
   method to get some default behavior. [hexsprite]

1.0.1 (2007-08-14)
==================

 - For consistency with other similar recipes, the recipe now sets a
   ``location`` option which may be read by other sections to learn
   where the package was extracted. This is an alias for the
   ``destination`` option.

1.0.0
=====

 - First public release.
