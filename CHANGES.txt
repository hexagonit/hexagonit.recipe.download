   Alexander Ivanov. [dokai]

1.2.1 (2008-04-13)
==================

 - Rename the buildout ``download-directory`` option to ``download-cache``
   (which is the name used by buildout) [thefunny]

   emit a deprecation warning and set the ``download-cache`` option
   accordingly. [dokai]

1.2.0 (2008-01-19)
==================

 - Added the `download-only` option to allow downloading arbitrary
   files. [dokai]

   directory. For more info see ``calculate_base`` method on ``Recipe`` class.

 - Recipe is now a new-style Python class so recipe subclasses can use super()
   method to get some default behavior. [hexsprite]

1.0.1 (2007-08-14)
==================

 - For consistency with other similar recipes, the recipe now sets a
   ``location`` option which may be read by other sections to learn
   where the package was extracted. This is an alias for the
   ``destination`` option.

=====

 - First public release.
